Homework assignments from my ME EN 1010 course that taught me the basics of MATLAB. This taught me much of the knowledge needed for my final "Virtual Mechatronic System" project. All credit of the creation of these assignments goes to Dr. Debra Mascaro of the University of Utah. The code used to complete the assignment, however, was developed on my own.
