# HW-Code--CmptrProbSolv
Here are homework assignments from my ME EN 1010 course that taught me the basics of MATLAB and Arduino. This taught me much of the knowledge needed for my final "Virtual Mechatronic System" project. All credit of the creation of these assignments goes to Dr. Debra Mascaro of the University of Utah. However, the written code was developed all on my own. Homework topics that utilized MATLAB and Arduino within these assignments include:
-Projectile motion analysis
-Usage of functions and inbuilt 
-Data collection and graphing
-Image processing
